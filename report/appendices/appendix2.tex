\chapter{Elaborate Results}
\label{appendix2}

When run the bash script to automatize the workload, for each version, different log files
are created. Inside them are present all the information about each single execution and main ones are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item DFG name,
    \item Are constrain used,
    \item Latency obtained.
\end{itemize}

Thorough the python script \emph{elaborate\_result.py}, all these data are elaborate to create different graphs.

The bar graph is created starting from the DFG used and the area constrain applied. Then for each version is displayed the time 
spend to conclude the execution and, when is present, also CPU executions are show.
