\chapter{Convert DFG}\
\label{appendix1}

The extension .dot it's a file format suitable for 
representing DFG in a graphical way. For the purpose of
this project this kind of format is not very efficient and so     
the following python script has been written to convert 
it in a more easy one. Start from the original file
the script read all the node and than in the new file are written:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the number of node n;
    \item n rows representing the pair name node and operation node.
\end{itemize}

Then also the edge are read and in the file are written:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the number of edge e;
    \item e rows representing the pair starting node and arrival node.
\end{itemize}

The produced file is saved in .txt format.

In this way the reading in C language is much more easier and more faster and the DFG remains the same.

To se the graphical representation of DFG the .dot file is needed while to run the GPU scheduling 
the conversion format is used.

DFG with .dot extension are available under folder \emph{DFGs} while DFG converted are 
available under folder \emph{DFGs\_new}.
